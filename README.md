# UC3M-imuBNO055
This work presents a test to evaluate the accuracy of the BNO055 IMU sensor integrated with an Arduino board, which transmits its data via Bluetooth to a Python program. The Python program communicates through sockets with the ABB CRB 15000 robot controller to perform automated movements.
