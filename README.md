# UC3M-IMU-Position-Tracking
This work presents a test to evaluate the accuracy of the BNO055 IMU sensor integrated with an Arduino board, which transmits its data via Bluetooth to a Python program. The Python program communicates through sockets with the ABB CRB 15000 robot controller to perform automated movements. The test consists of rotating the robot's tool axis in controlled increments of 10 degrees, either about its own axis or along a semicircular path with a radius specified by the operator. The operator can also select the IMU axis (x, y, or z) to measure during the test. The process is fully automated, enabling systematic data collection from the IMU sensor at each movement increment to validate its measurements across all axes.
